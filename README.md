# Applied Statistics and Data Science (Python & R)

This repository contains the final assignment for a Coursera course on statistics and data science, implemented using both Python and R.

## Overview
The project applies fundamental statistical concepts and data analysis techniques to explore and analyze a given dataset. The focus is on practical application rather than advanced modeling.

## Tools Used
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- R (base R, tidyverse)

## Files
- `analysis_python.ipynb` – Statistical analysis and visualizations in Python  
- `analysis_r.R` – Equivalent analysis implemented in R  

## Notes
This project was completed as part of a Coursera course and is shared here for learning and demonstration purposes.
